                My name is Edel Marcelino and I have worked in the computer technology industry for over 15 years. 
                I started out working as a computer repair technician in college, then worked as a Systems Administrator 
                intern during my senior year, until I graduated with my degree in Computer Engineering from SDSU. I have 
                since worked as a Systems Engineer, Cybersecurity Engineer, and Application Development Engineer.
                <br><br>
                I am currently taking this bootcamp to learn new skills to keep up with todays fast moving and ever 
                changing technology landscape.
